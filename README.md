## How to Run the App

To run this application locally, you will need **Node.js** installed on your machine.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd shopping_list
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Start the Application

You need to run **two separate terminals** to start the app (one for the backend, one for the frontend).

**Terminal 1: Start the Mock Backend**
This runs the JSON server on port 3000 to handle data persistence.
```bash
npm run server
```

**Terminal 2: Start the Frontend**
This runs the Vite development server.
```bash
npm run dev
```

Open your browser and navigate to the URL shown in Terminal 2 (usually `http://localhost:5173`).
